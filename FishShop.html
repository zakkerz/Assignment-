<p> Fishpond Fish shop in Bristol is a large store which specialises in tropical and marine fish. Our tropical fish section houses an extensive range of community species such as tetras, livebearers, gouramis and corydoras catfish, as well as the more unusual specimens such as knifefish and "elephant noses" for the dedicated oddball-keeper. Both Malawis and Tanganyikan cichlids are also stocked along with a selection of other cichlids.</p>
